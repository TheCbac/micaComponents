CHANGE LOG
libMICA - MICA Components - v1

2018.08.22 CC
* Writing unit tests for the packets in DriveBot
* Should add an sprintf equivalent to uartApi
* PICKUP: fix creation tests - No reason to use the TX payloadMax param

2018.08.08 CC
# Buttons.c/h
* Add wasButtonReleased                                  ✓
* Add release isr callback                               ✓
# packets.h
* Make packet structures conform to v1.3 standard
    * Merge PACKET_RECEIVE_S and PACKET_SEND_S
    * Update BUFFER_SEND_S and BUFFER_RECEIVE_S

2018.08.03 CC
* Create a testing component
* Move the Packet unit tests to own project

2018.08.01 CC
# packets.c
* Move errors detecting to parse packets

2018.07.31 CC
# TODO - UART_API
* Add macro for starting the designated UART
    e.g. UART_USB_Start() -> usbUart_Start()
# TODO - Packets
* Switch to using heap for buffers
* Double buffer Packets
* Switch to flag errors

2018.07.30 CC
# PACKETS_v1_0
* Modify packet struct to enable pure functions
* Pick up on investigating why the receive side errors out
* maybe split into send and receive packet format

2018.07.25 CC 
# MICA Components Library
* Create a "Dual Quadrature Encoder"                        ✓
* Revisit Packets component
* Change function sendResponsePacket -> createResponse Packets
    i.e. get rid of UART dependencies in the component
* Build buffer and status into packet component

# DriveBot v5
* Abstract "boardTesting.c/.h" out of the design            ✓
* Clean up all testing functions                            ✓

2018.07.03 CC - PUSH_BUTTON
* Create initial push button component                      ✓

2018.06.11 CC - UART_API
* change from functions to uart name and SCB option?

2018.06.04 - BMX component CC
* Create two accelerometer data types - float and int16     ✓
* Create two gyroscope data types - float and int16         ✓
* Convert Power states to enumerated types                  ✓
* Create devices state structs                              ✓
* Update BMX device functions                               ✓
* Update ACC functions                                      ✓
* Update GYR functions                                      ✓
* Update MAG functions                                      ✓
* Switch read functions to state variable not device specific (&imuState.acc -> &imuState)
* Create inclinometer Component                             ✓
* Add state check to read functions                         ✓
